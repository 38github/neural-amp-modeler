# NAM: neural amp modeler

Let's use deep learning to make a model of a guitar amp!

## Autoregressive models

* Fully-connected (n-to-1)

## To do

* Other models
* Real-time (eventually)
* Model stereo outputs
* Data classes for .wav data, keeping sample rate, etc
* spek.cc?

## Other interesting tidbits?

* Audio analysis plugins: vamp-plugins.org
* Spectrogram: sonicvisualiser.org
